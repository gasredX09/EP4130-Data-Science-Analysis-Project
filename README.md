## Image Compression with K-Means Clustering
"Image Compression with K-Means Clustering" explores a method to reduce the storage space required for digital images while preserving visual quality. The technique leverages the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group similar pixel colors together and represent them with fewer colors. This process significantly reduces the number of bits needed to store the image, resulting in efficient compression. By assigning each pixel to its closest centroid, the original image can be reconstructed with minimal loss of information. Experimental results demonstrate substantial compression ratios, making this approach valuable for optimizing storage and transmission of images in various applications.
